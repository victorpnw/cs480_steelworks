"""
test_recurring_defect_service.py — Unit tests for the RecurringDefectService.

These tests verify the *business logic* in isolation — no real database is
involved.  Instead we create plain Python objects (``InspectionRecord``,
``Lot``, ``Defect``) in memory and feed them to the service through a fake
repository.

Key concepts for beginners:
    pytest:     Run all tests with ``poetry run pytest``.  Any function whose
                name starts with ``test_`` is automatically discovered.
    Fixture:    A ``@pytest.fixture`` is a reusable setup step.  pytest injects
                it into your test function by matching the parameter name.
    Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA):
                1. *Arrange* — set up test data and dependencies.
                2. *Act* — call the function you're testing.
                3. *Assert* — check that the result matches expectations.

Acceptance Criteria covered:
    AC1 — Recurring classification (>1 week, >1 lot)
    AC2 — Not recurring (single lot only)
    AC3 — Zero-defect records excluded
    AC4 — Insufficient data flag
    AC5 — Summary list fields
    AC7 — Drill-down detail (weekly breakdown + raw records)
    AC8 — Missing period identification
    AC9 — Default sort order
