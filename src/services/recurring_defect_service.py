"""
recurring_defect_service.py — Business logic for recurring defect analysis.

This is the "brain" of the feature.  It takes raw inspection records from the
repository, applies the acceptance-criteria rules (AC1–AC4), and returns
structured DTOs that the UI can display directly.

Key concepts for beginners:
    Service layer:  Sits between the UI and the repository.  It contains the
                    *rules* ("is this defect recurring?") but does NOT know
                    how to render HTML or run SQL — those jobs belong to the
                    UI layer and repository layer respectively.
    Dependency Injection:  Instead of creating its own repository, this class
                           *receives* one through its constructor.  This makes
                           testing easy — in tests you can pass a fake repo.

Acceptance Criteria mapping:
    AC1 → ``classify_defects``  (recurring = >1 week AND >1 lot)
    AC2 → ``classify_defects``  (single-lot → not recurring)
    AC3 → ``classify_defects``  (skip records with qty_defects == 0)
    AC4 → ``classify_defects``  (incomplete data → insufficient data)
    AC5 → ``get_recurring_defect_list``  (builds the summary table rows)
    AC7 → ``get_defect_detail``  (weekly breakdown + raw records)
    AC8 → ``get_missing_periods``  (identifies data gaps)
    AC9 → ``get_recurring_defect_list``  (default sort order)
